Working features:
- JButton rendering
- JPanel display

Features that did not work:
- Starting the animation

    One large problem was that we received our code late from our providers so we ran into
    issues, but due to the timeline, we weren't able to let our providers know so they had
    time to make the changes we requested.

    We were able to render the JButtons for controlling the hybrid view, but we were
    unable to render the animation itself. The provider's code had a method called animate() in
    their model interface, but our model did not have any methods related to initializing or
    starting a view in order to separate the responsibilities as much as possible.

    Upon requesting the code change, the providers did not have time to fix the design choice.



        The provided code also had a representation of visibility in their Shape class, and
    we suggested they move their representation of visible shapes to be a list of visible shapes
    in their view, but, again they did not have time to make such changes.

        If they were able

The other buttons relied on the animation already running, so we were unable to get those to
work as well.

The SVG output feature worked successfully.
