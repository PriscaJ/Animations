Overall Implementation and design: Primarily designed to mimic the Command Pattern in order to
simplify the model interface. Through the command pattern the classes for shapes do not become
concerned with how they will be modified since the Animation itself takes care of it. The Model
loads all the shapes that will be used in the animation in a list then the Shape has its own list
of animation commands which will each invoke the neccessary animation Action (Move, ColorChange,
ScaleChange).

Interface AnimationOperations
This is the main interface for the model which contains the methods and behaviors that a model
should have in order to run an animation. Methods such as getShape that returns the shapes in the
current animation.

class AnimationModel - implements AnimationOperations
Field(s): CHANGE
List<Animations> animations; There is a list if all the actions that will occur in ab animation.
Map<String, Shapes> shapesMap; All shapes are stored in a Hashmap to directly attach it from the
shape's name to the actual Shape.
List<Shapes> shapes; Instead of a specified Array LIst of shapes it is generalized to List, but it
still represents all the shapes that are contained in this animation.


Interface Shapes

DESIGN CHANGE
class AbstractShape
There is an abstract class for Shape since some qualities of a shape can mostly be shared between an
oval and a rectangle. If there needs to be an additional shape added in the future a new class will
be added and extend the Abstract shape if it has similar funtionality. Instead of an enum type which
can complicate the behaviors for a shape that does not align completely with an Abstract Shape.

Field(s):
 ArrayList<AnimationCommand> commands Commands that will be called for to call animation actions
 for this shape
  private String name The unique name that a shape has.
  private double width, height The Dimensions of the shape
  private int appears, disappears The lifespan of a shape.
  private Point position The position whether that be the center or the lower left corner
  private Color color the color of the shape

Interface AnimationCommands

The commands are used to decouple the responsibilities between a shape and an Animation action. The
Shape does not worry about how it will be animated it only called the Command which invokes its
field to call on its animation action

class MoveCommand
Field(s) Move the Action of the Animation

class ScaleCommand
Field(s) ScaleChange the Action of the Animation

class ColorCommand
Field(s) ColorChange the Action of the Animation

Interface Animations

DESIGN CHANGE
abstract class AbstractAnimation - implements Animations
Field(s): protected fields for
protected String name;
protected float startX;
protected float startY;
  protected float endX;
  protected float endY;
  protected int startTime;
  protected int endTime;
  protected Shapes animatingShape = null;
  protected AnimationType type = null;

These are the classes that actually perform the action called they have a method that applies the
action it is attached to.
