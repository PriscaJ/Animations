 We did not make any changes to our Assignment 8 code at all. Our customers never reached
 out to us with any issues so we assumed that all was well.

 When designing our code we were mindful of keeping our view and model responsibilities
 decoupled and delegated to the correct classes. We also were careful to eliminate
 tight coupling between classes.
